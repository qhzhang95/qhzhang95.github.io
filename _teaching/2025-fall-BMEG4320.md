Course Outline
======
This course provides knowledge and technical background on the current available AI and imaging technologies developed for biomedical engineering applications. The AI part introduces fundamental concepts of deep learning, neural networks, and machine intelligence, exploring their recent applications in clinical diagnostics. The imaging part emphasis lies on introducing advanced biomedical imaging modalities, including advanced optical imaging systems (e.g., super-resolution optical imaging, optical coherence tomography, two-photo microscopy, digital holographic microscopy, and so on), functional MRI, and other advanced imaging modalities. It also covers applications of advanced biomedical imaging in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases. Selected topics relating to use the above AI and imaging technologies for evaluation of neurodegeneration diseases and cancers will be covered.
